# Project4
My fourth Project for Data Structures


Project four implements a hashtable. It takes the country information from the csv file and the hash function inserts into the hash table based on the name. The project uses an array of linked lists to deal with collisions. From here the project deletes and searches for certain countries in the hash table by the country name. Lastly, the program prints out the hash table and how many empty spaces and collisions there are in the hash table.
